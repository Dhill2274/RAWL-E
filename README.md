## Introduction
RAWL-E is a method for developing ethical norm-learning agents that implement the maximin principle from Rawlsian ethics in their decision-making processes. This codebase facilitates the creation of agents that promote ethical norms by balancing societal well-being with individual goals. Evaluations in simulated harvesting scenarios demonstrate that RAWL-E agents enhance social welfare, fairness, and robustness, resulting in improved minimum experiences compared to agents that do not utilise Rawlsian ethics.

## Initialisation
To set up the environment, create a virtual environment using:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Activate the environment:

```bash
conda activate renv
```

## Usage

To run the code, use the following command:

```bash
python run.py [train] [test] [graphs]
```

## Arguments

The following arguments can be used with the `run.py` script:

- `train`: Train the norm-learning agent.
- `test`: Evaluate the performance of the trained agent.
- `graphs`: Generate relevant plots for analysis.
